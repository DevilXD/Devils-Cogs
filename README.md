# Devils-Cogs

Welcome to my cogs repository - hopefully you'll find something useful here =)

My cogs and a short description:
***
- InviteUtils - allows for fully customizable 'welcome' and 'leave' messages, and allows you to grant a role to the user that joins with a specific invite.
***
- GlobalRole - allows you to add or remove a role from all server members at once. Simple and compact, only one command!
***
- Counting - allows you to set up counting channels for your own and other people entertainment. Can also set up counting goals and has an optional strict mode.
